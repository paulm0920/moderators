# Basic concepts of TEA and CML
Assum you have already read TEA project token economy write paper. You are supposed to have the basic knowledge about TEA and CML. 

TEA is stable utility token, CML is NFT. Miners need to have a CML seeds to plant into a mining machine so that he can mine TEA token.

# Seeds round investment
TEA Project starts March 2019. in Jun 2021, TEA Project closed the seeds round fundraising. In one month, TEA raised 1M USD equivlent crypto at the evaluation of 10M USD. 

Unlike the traditional token fundraising, the team (TEA project) doesn't sell TEA token to the investor. Actually the team has no TEA token at all. There won't be any TEA token in the genesis block. What the team sell to the investors are CML frozen seeds - the NFT.

# Frozen Camellia Seeds

There will be 10,000 frozen camellia seeds when the TEA main net starts in the genesis block. That all the asset the team and investors co-own. By the end of all the fund raising and right before the genesis block, the team will sell 40% of the frozen seeds to all rounds investors and keep the rest 60%. 

The frozen seeds sold to the investors have a different [[defrost schedule]]. 
# Seeds type A/B/C
All seeds have three levels/types. A B and C.
A is most expensive and most powerful. C is the least.
There are 10% A seeds, 30% B seeds and 60 % C seeds.

There is a [[lucky draw]] in the blockchain so that the investor can redeem their [[coupon]] to frozen camellia seeds.  
# Coupon
Because the seeds are all generated at the genesis block when mainnet starts. Before that, investors will get a series of "coupons". Coupons are also tokens. Each token has properties of
- It is an investor defrost schedule or team defrost schedule
- what type of seeds is it (Type A/B/C)

The token can be transferred as if they are stock. 

Once the mainnet starts, anyone who owns the coupon in the blockchain can redeem by a "lucky draw" action on the chain. One coupon will be convert randomly to a frozen CML seeds based on the coupon property (defrost schedule, and seeds type).

# The price of coupon
In the seeds round fundraising. 5 investors spend 1M USD purchased 1000 coupon. So each coupon worth 1000 USD.

In our next seres A round, we play to sell the next 1000 coupon at price of 5000 USD/coupon.

We probably have the private sale round at last, we do not have expectation on the price yet, probably raise to 10000 USD / coupon.

# Incentive to moderators

the incentive to moderators come from the combination of two options.

## Crytocurrency incentive
In USDT/USDC. Moderators are paid bi-weekly, or task-based.

## CML seeds incentive
The team will reserve team's coupon as incentive to the moderators.
We define 1/100 coupon as one point. Once the moderator earn 100 points, he can exchange for one coupon. One coupon currently worth 1000 USD, and planed 5000 USD in seres A. But if he did not get to 100 points, we cannot exchange to one coupon because the NFT is  not splitable.

We can set points for each task, or for long-term moderators as part of their compensation. We will leave the choice to the moderators. A combination of USD and Points, just need to decide the composition (ratio)
(())
For those who take portion of their compensation in coupon points rather than USD, we will match 100% points as bonus. For example, if someone is supposed to receive 1000 USD. He is willing to take 500 USD and 500 worth of coupon points. The price of coupon points we fix to $10 / points. This is the price of the coupon at our seeds round fundraising (1000 USD / coupon). So he will receive 500 USD and 10 coupon points. We will give him additional 10 coupon points. So he actually receives 500 USD and 20 coupon points. Based on the price of our seeds round. He actually received 1500 USD rather than 1000 USD. Not to mention the price of coupon may raise in the future rounds of fundraising.

Every 100 coupon points can exchange for one coupon, that is one CML seed.

Coupon points and coupon and frozen seeds are all token, They are transferrable. 

One thing need to mention: The coupon and seeds they received are the seeds original belonging to the TEA Project team. You can find the differences between team seeds and investor seeds. They are different defrost schedule. The only way to get investor's seeds is to join the investment activity and you have to be a acredit investor to be qualified.
