# Community Building
This is similar to the Content Generation project.  	 
The differences are:
- Each card is a task, an event, a plan, not an article
- There would be a budget associate with the card. 

Any moderator may propose an idea to the project. If get approved, he will follow this idea till the end. Or, assign to someone else.
