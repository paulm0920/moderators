# Moderators

This repository is for TEA moderators. If you are not moderator but have accessed to this repo, you must be our external helper. Welcome too.

# Use Obsidian to read and write
Although you can read those MD file directly on the web or any local editor, the best way to read and edit these MD files is using Obsidian. https://obsidian.md/ 

Without using Obsidian, you may see many `[[Obsidian links`but you cannot click it and jump into.  That's why I strongly recommended you download https://obsidian.md/ and install. Once done, set the vault folder to your local  root of this  repository. Be sure you learn the basic usage of Obsidian. I bet you won't waste your time on learning this new tool.
