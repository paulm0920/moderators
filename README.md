# Moderators

This repository is for TEA moderators. If you are not moderator but have accessed to this repo, you must be our external helper. Welcome too.

## Who are moderators
There are other names such as Evangelist, Influence, Ambassador, or whatever. Each of them may be a little different but we can them all moderator here. You can still call yourself an Ambassador if it sounds better to you.

The responsibilities of the moderators are:
- Help more people understand TEA and become the community members
- Managing different social media channels/groups, keep them a healthy, friendly environment
- Tech writers or video makers. Producing social content and publish to social media, broadcasts them. 
- Test and use our testing platform. Bug bounty.
- Join the mining and become a TEA farmer.
- Vote in the TEA DAO. Become a responsible DAO member. Take the ownership.

## How to become a moderator

First, join the TEA community from any social media.
If you think you are qualified and willing to take the responsibilities (mentioned above)l, please talk to existing moderator / admin in your social channel/group. Your existing moderator will tell you what's the next.

## Paid tasks
Besides those volunteer works most moderators are doing, there are also some paid tasks.

You will need to follow the [[workflow]]. Make sure you read it before moving on.


# Use Obsidian to read and write
Although you can read those MD file directly on the web or any local editor, the best way to read and edit these MD files is using Obsidian. https://obsidian.md/ 

Without using Obsidian, you may see many `[[Obsidian links`but you cannot click it and jump into.  That's why I strongly recommended you download https://obsidian.md/ and install. Once done, set the vault folder to your local  root of this  repository. Be sure you learn the basic usage of Obsidian. I bet you won't waste your time on learning this new tool.
