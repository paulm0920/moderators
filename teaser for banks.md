Feel free to edit and modify this article, fix errors.

the goal of this article is a short teaser doc for Singapore Banks when open bank accont. They require a brief introduction of the TEA Project. The existing teasure doc is too technical for those banking clerks. So I write a new one specially for them.

# Teaser

The majority of internet computing is handled by a few cloud computing infrastructure providers, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft; all centralized platforms. Because of this, issues such as monopoly, privacy, and safety concerns arise. TEA Project aims to eliminate these problems by building a decentralized cloud computing platform based on blockchain technologies. The computing will be handled by millions of TEA nodes owned by their respective crypto miners. The TEA blockchain follows a carefully designed protocol that ensures computing tasks are randomly assigned to anonymous nodes to protect against hacker attacks.  Since TEA is a decentralized organization, there is also a token economy designed to incentivize miners. The way it works is simple: miners provide computing services; in return, they receive TEA (the stable utility) tokens as a reward. Miners do not need a supercomputer or datacenter to join the TEA network, it is only required that they have a computer with a security chip and a software license called 'Camellia token' (CML, a Non-fungible-token NFT).  
  
TEA Project Pte Ltd is the software company that designs this blockchain-powered decentralized cloud computing platform. The software is open-sourced. The company makes revenue by:

1) Joining the computing service along with other miners

2) Selling the software license (CML NFT) to other miners/investors who also want to provide such computing services to clients.
