# Goals

- Our team is very distributed all over the world , in different timezone. using these kind of tool and follow the workflow is very important.
- Try to avoid face	to face conversation or instance messaging as much as possible. Everyone can just follow the workflow and complete task and get paid asynchronous. 
- All works are logged, monitored and subject to future audition. 
- We trust everyone is honest. but the system can easily find out dishonest behaviors by verification by others in public.

# Basic rules
## Using Github issues
- If an issue is not assigned to you. Someone else is taking care of it. 
- If an issue is assigned to you, you are taking responsibility to complete this issue/task as soon as possible. When done, assign it to your down streaming handler. 
- When you complete a task, always write done the working hours on this issue. If you do not log, you won't get paid
- If you got any questions, always write in the comments. @others if you want him to be notified. Note, as long as the issue is still assigned to you, you are the sole people taking responsibility. 
- Do not close any issue unless you create that issue by yourself. Always send it to whoever has the right to review and close the issue. Usually it is the one who create the issue, or who is assigned to be reviewer. let him review and close it. 
- If you are writing several issues into one issue, you are wrong. Write them into several separated issues. Each issue contains one task so that it can be assigned and completed separately. 
- When writing in issues, always copy paste links when you refer to other issues or project or markdown files. There might be many contents have the similar name. 

## Using Github Project
- If you have an idea, write it in a card and post it to the Proposal column. Your manager will decide weather it is valid or not. Your manager will move to Under Discussion or ToDo. 
- When a card is under discussion, it is still not get approved yet. Only those under ToDo are considered "ready to go"
- Your manager will convert a card to an issue when it is ToDo column. In some cases, you can assign to yourself too. 
- Once it is assigned to you, you can start working on it. Make sure you also move this card from ToDo to In Progress column so that others know you are working on it.
- When you complete an issue, move the card to Review. Also assign this issue to whoever can review it. Usually your manager, or someone who create this issue.
- When the reviewer consider this task is completed, he will move it to Done. Also close this issue.

## Code commit
- If you do not have write access to this repo, you can fork and make pull request
- Always make meaningful commit message.
- Use branch when needed.
- For new moderators that may not familiar with our workflow, ask them to commit to his own branch first, then send a Pull Request. Do not allow them to merge directly until you can trust his work.
