Workflow Details: Copied From Telegram 

1. Our team is very distributed all over the world , in different timezone. using these kind of tool is very important.

2. For example, when @Alakhani has an idea to create a contact list page for all of us. He can create a new card in the Proposal column here: https://github.com/tearust/moderators/projects/2#column-14866349

3. If I think it makes sense, and no need for group discussion, I will move it to Todo here: https://github.com/tearust/moderators/projects/2#column-14865093
then AI can take this card, convert it to an issue, such as this one https://github.com/tearust/moderators/issues/5  also move the card to “in progress” here:https://github.com/tearust/moderators/projects/2#column-14865094

So that everyone will know what just happened, and who is working on which issue.
Once AI done the task, send to me for review. then finally done.
Make sure add a time log on the task when complete. this is be used for payment
