# Workflow Details: Copied From Telegram 

1. Our team is very distributed all over the world , in different timezone. using these kind of tool is very important.

2. For example, when @Alakhani has an idea to create a contact list page for all of us. He can create a new card in the Proposal column here: https://github.com/tearust/moderators/projects/2#column-14866349

3. If I think it makes sense, and no need for group discussion, I will move it to Todo here: https://github.com/tearust/moderators/projects/2#column-14865093
then AI can take this card, convert it to an issue, such as this one https://github.com/tearust/moderators/issues/5  also move the card to “in progress” here:https://github.com/tearust/moderators/projects/2#column-14865094

So that everyone will know what just happened, and who is working on which issue.
Once AI done the task, send to me for review. then finally done.
Make sure add a time log on the task when complete. this is be used for payment

## Additional notice on how to use issue
If you are working on an issue, already assign this issue to yourself. If an issue is not assign to you. do not work on it, because someone else is working on it. We do not want conflicts.

If you want to assign the issue to someone else, always make enough comments making sure that guy can follow up. For example, if you have completed a task and assign to me for reviewing, please always write comments on this issue with what you have done, the links to your work, commit, pushed files etc. So that I can continue review your work. Do NOT rely on instant messaging to transfer information like that, since there is no way to track the messages in the IM.


For paid task/ issue, always have your working hours when you complete the task. This will be used for calculate your compensation. If you do not add the hours, you will not get paid, seriously.

## Additional notice on how to use Git

Assuming you all know how to use Git. If you do not, please leave Git first.

Some requirements:
Always make meaningful commit message.
Use branch when needed.
For new moderators that may not familiar with our workflow, ask them to commit to his own branch first, then send a Pull Request. Do not allow them to merge directly until you can trust his work.
Write comments to other commits, do NOT use instant messaging to comment. There is no way to track.
