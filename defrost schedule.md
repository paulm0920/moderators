Every frozen seed has a different defrost time. This time is set in genesis block by a random algorithm.

The algorithm follow a defrost schedule to set the random defrost time. 

There are two schedule so far:
- investor schedule
- team schedule


# Investor schedule 
- total 10% of investor's seeds are defrost at block height 0. that means they can be defrost right after genesis block
- the rest 90% will be distributed to 18 months. On the 12 to 18th day of a month, there will be 5% seeds to be defrost.

# Team schedule
- There is no seeds to be defrost in the first 2 months.
- Starting form the 3rd month, there will be 5% seeds to be defrost between the 12 to 18th day of a month, for the next 20 months.
