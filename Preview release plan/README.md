# Preview versions and features
## Preview 1
Plan to release by the end of July 2021
### What features are in this release and what are not
Core team will run more than 4 test nodes of the substrate powered blockchain.
Test users will not run their own nodes.
Test users can use tea wallet web dapp. No mobile client.
Preview version will have multiple epoch. Inside each epoch, the blockchain will have a genesis block and grow over the time in the [[fast mode]]. At the end of every epoch, all data will be reset and the block will start from scratch again in the new epoch. In the main net this won't happen.

During each epoch, there would be some hot upgrades happen. We do not guarantee the hot upgrades can keep all data. This is a preview test version.

Whoever want to join the test should fill up a google form [[Investor List Form]] before next epoch starts. When the new epoch starts, the genesis block will contain CML coupon for those who filled in the form. They are "investors" in this epoch. 

When new epoch starts, investors will see their CML coupon in TEA wallet web app. 

They can redeem their coupon to CML seeds. In [[fast mode]], half of the seeds are defrosted by default. So tester can easily find one or two seeds that are defrosted already, they do not need to wait to defrost to start testing.

Testers can plant defrost seeds to a fake mining machine. In Preview 1, testers do not need to deploy any mining machine. The system will skip this step to offer you a free fake mining machine and start mining immediately. 

Tester plant a seed to a mining machine. It can start generate TEA reward to this miner.

Once the tester has enough fund to stake the T token to a Camellia, it can stake and gain dividends. 

Tester can transfer T token and coupon to others.

Tester can sell / buy Camellia or seeds on Marketplace.

Tester can unstake
