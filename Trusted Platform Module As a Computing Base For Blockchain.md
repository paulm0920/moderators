**# Trusted Platform Module As a Computing Base For Blockchain

## A Brief History of TPM and Blockchain

TPM (Trusted Platform Module) has been around since 1999 and was used in the Microsoft Operating System (Windows 7/Server 2008). It is a hardware security module integrated on the motherboard. TPM can offload cryptographic operations from software to increase speed and efficiency, it also enables secure storage of keys for signing, hashing or encryption making blockchain safer.

  

It must be noted that blockchain runs on top of an established distributed ledger system such as blockchain. Each blockchain transaction needs to be signed by the private key and sent to all blockchain nodes before adding it onto the blockchain which takes some time let's say 10 minutes which gives plenty of time for fraudsters to alter any data especially if single operator controls 51% or more of computing power required for blockchain to run. 

  

TPM enables blockchain to run faster and efficiently, it guarantees the blockchain node that only blockchain approved software can take part in blockchain transactions, because of this, many blockchain applications are now being implemented using TPM.

  

By implementing blockchain technology with TPM, we increase its security for both business and public sector. 

## How Blockchain Technology Works

Transactions are signed digitally before broadcasted onto any blockchain node. Nodes spread transactions across the network, other nodes receive these transactions, verify them including checking if funds are available before broadcasting onto their own network. After broadcasted blockchain nodes will check any incoming blockchain transaction against all blockchain transactions and only adds it to blockchain if the digital signature matches previous blockchain data.

### Cryptocurrency Forks

It is essential to note that blockchain works on top of a distributed ledger system, one must also understand what cryptocurrency forks are when discussing blockchain. Forking is separating part of a blockchain into another chain once an update to software takes place in the original blockchain for any reasons whatsoever. As long as there's consensus or majority within each network (forks) then blockchain continues running as normal although some cryptocurrencies choose to remain on old tech creating new chains thus forking blockchain entirely but this occurs rarely and usually with few miners taking part in both networks(the old and new network).

### Blockchain Challenges And Future Of Blockchain Technology

  

The blockchain itself has some potential threats, blockchain is still in its infancy and there are many technological challenges that blockchain faces. Currently blockchain businesses and industry must come up with a solution that can tackle three main issues

#### Lack of trust 

From the public sector to use it as a base for future governance systems and services. This is due to the lack of understanding blockchain technology which leads to bad press especially when one hears about cryptocurrency hacks or blockchain being used by criminals thus leading them to think blockchain is the problem rather than criminal activity using blockchain as a tool

#### Privacy concerns 

This comes from not keeping information confidential blockchain as blockchain is distributed thus a blockchain node can see any blockchain transaction however if blockchain stores data on central servers and that information falls into the wrong hands then privacy becomes an issue.

#### Scalability

Blockchain currently has issues with scalability due to slow transactions processing speed, this makes blockchain inefficient for most applications but one must note that blockchain nodes do not run on single server meaning blockchain will always outrun single server systems, thus scalability comes for free in blockchain running distributed across many different nodes however this also means blockchain generally takes longer time to process transactions especially complex ones such as smart contracts or storing large files. One solution could be implementing TPM which will enable faster and efficient operations within each blockchain network.

  

The future blockchain governance systems blockchain needs to focus on the public sector since blockchain is a completely new technology it will take some time before blockchain can become mainstream, for blockchain to be accepted by businesses and general public blockchain must first gain trust from these sectors as its not only about blockchain being secure but also about blockchain providing services that are affordable and more importantly useful.

### The Rise Of Trusted Platform Module Technology In Blockchain

TPM itself specializes in hardware security module (HSM) which plays a vital role in securing blockchain network via trusted computing solutions, TPM was designed from ground up with the intention of securing and protecting digital assets especially where there are a lot of transactions going while keeping control over who has access to what information avoiding any tampering or theft of blockchain data. 

TPM is a chip within your computer, laptop or tablet that provides security for blockchain technology through various methods such as storing blockchain on the device itself rather than using blockchain nodes that store blockchain on their central servers meaning blockchain users can keep control over what information they want to share and with whom.

### Blockchain Security - How Trusted Platform Module Technology Solves Blockchain Challenges

The blockchain network has three main pillars; 1- Decentralized consensus (mining) 2- Cryptographic mechanisms 3- Distributed databases .Keeping these three pillars running in an environment that can be accessed by anyone anywhere securely without causing chaos means blockchain needs to utilize trusted technology to provide blockchain security and prevent hacking attempts even from nation states who have the resources and talent to hack blockchain. 

  

Blockchain security is important as blockchain has the potential of being used in business & industry for many different applications ranging from finance to logistics where blockchain can make these sectors more efficient and profitable blockchain cannot be hacked into and tampered with since every blockchain transaction is validated by a mining node who share their results with other nodes thus all blockchain network nodes will always have the same data meaning any attempt at hacking blockchain is not only highly unlikely but also impossible due to each blockchain node having exact information making it next to impossible for hackers to break blockchain encryption.

### Why TPM Is The Ideal Computing Base For Blockchain

Distributed servers does not equal decentralized due to centralization risk, lack of availability usually resulting from location factor, thus blockchain needs to utilize TPM to be more efficient and effective it does not make sense running blockchain nodes on centralized servers considering blockchain is a form of decentralized service blockchain nodes need to be run across various locations meaning blockchain nodes also must be secure this is where blockchain integration with trusted technology comes in.

#### TPM Will Enable Faster And More Efficient Operations In Blockchain

TPM will provide blockchain with faster and efficient operations by keeping blockchain data as close to the end user as possible using encrypted storage solutions tailored for blockchain use cases which could range from small files such as documents or media assets up to larger files such as content shared over blockchain. 

  

Using blockchain tailored encryption solutions makes it impossible for unauthorized access and tampering of blockchain data since blockchain nodes can authenticate what blockchain user is accessing blockchain from which blockchain node and blockchain data itself can be encrypted stored locally on a TPM chip or on the cloud. For example; blockchain will become part of your everyday life, you will have blockchain shares for your business activities as well as part of your daily work routine, when you buy goods online you will pay using blockchain via a decentralized cryptocurrency payment processor that will store money in an encrypted way on TPM chips until you decide how to spend them this allows fast secure financial transactions without the need for third party trust.

#### TPM Integrates With The Cloud To Provide Unhackable Security And Privacy

Cloud integration with blockchain needs to be done with a blockchain focused encryption solution to make sure blockchain data remains private as it should be, blockchain nodes distributed across various locations means blockchain must work in concurrence with the cloud where blockchain will use TPM chips to encrypt blockchain data and synchronize blockchain blocks stored on cloud storage solutions. 

  

For example; Blockchain is used for your personal files such as content of different types which can range from small documents or images up to larger files such as music and video content you share online with all blockchain users. Using blockchain tailored encryption techniques makes it near impossible for anyone unauthorized access since blockchain provides decentralization. 

  
This means no single entity is responsible for blockchain operations therefore whoever attempts hacking into blockchain would have to do so from thousands of locations around the globe and that's not easy considering blockchain blocks are encrypted on blockchain nodes and synchronized between blockchain nodes in the blockchain network further blockchain data is encrypted stored locally on TPM chips or cloud this guarantees blockchain security making blockchain safe to use.

 Blockchain is the future of technology. It offers a more secure, decentralized way to store data and perform transactions without third party interference or control. However, in order for blockchain to be successful it requires an ideal computing base that can make use of the cloud while also being able to encrypt and synchronize large amounts of data in real time across various locations - something TPMs are uniquely suited for. Blockchain tailored encryption solutions ensure security; meaning you don't have to worry about your personal files being accessed by unauthorized users when using this form of technology on TPM chips or stored securely on the Cloud with TPM integration.**
