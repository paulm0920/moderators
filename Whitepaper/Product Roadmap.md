The TEA Project started in 2019, and has been self funded until early 2021. 

In Nov. 2020, the TEA Project released the AI-based image recognition demo, running in a simulator of TPM-based secure computing nodes. 

In early 2021, our Gluon wallet application won Web3 Foundationâ€™s Open Grant. Subsequently we started to implement the TEA runtime on Amazon Nitro, which was completed in April 2021. 

In June 2021, the TEA Project completed the seed round funding.

In Q3 of 2021, we plan to be ready for pre-mining of $T tokens and for issuing CML tokens. 

In Q4 of 2021 or early 2022, we plan to have the main net ready for public mining of $T tokens. We also plan to have a TEA box ready for miners to purchase and use as mining machines.

In the second half of 2022, we plan to have trust-as-a-service ready to be adopted by other blockchain or non-blockchain platforms. We also plan to provide the SDK for running rich dApps on the TEA platform. 

In 2023, we plan to launch a TEA-based decentralized token exchange. We also plan to offer additional technology options for the mining nodes.
